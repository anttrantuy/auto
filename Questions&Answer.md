1. What is the benefit of automation test and why? Please provide some of your examples to prove that

Benefit of automation test:
- Save time, especially in Regression Testing, Cross-Browser Testing. In long term project, save time means save money,
and bring more return of investment 
- Continuity: Test can be always run (24/7) by PC
- Fewer human resources required, automation test team usually needs less human resource than a manual test team
- Reusability: when test framework is well-structured, it can be reused in many cases.
- Simultaneity: automation test can be distributed and run parallelly in many PCs/ devices via CI tools.
- Speed: Tests are run by tools which is faster than human
- Accuracy: automation tests can detect minor changes which human may not see (for example: xpath expression)

2. What makes a good automation test tool, and what is a bad one? Why?

A good automation test tool: 
- It should have utility to assert/compare 2 or more values (expected and actual result)--> to evaluate that tests are passed or failed
- It should have ability to run multiple test suites
- It should have facility to classify/ group test scenarios, test suites being run
- It should have clear progress monitoring tools
- It should have ability to generate various type of reports
...

A bad automation test tool: 
- It doesn't support deep intervention into actions/ configuration
- It doesn't support multiple tests run parallelly
- It doesn't have monitoring tools
- It support its own report format and can't be customized
